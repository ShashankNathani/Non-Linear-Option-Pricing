# Non-Linear Option-Pricing

This is a repository for pricing different options using simulation-based methods along with machine learning algorithms. PDE methods and their numerical approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Since most quantitative finance problems are high-dimensional simulation is used. <br> 
Four different cases are studied and it is advised to go through them in order. We look at the following problems : <br> 
<ul> <li> Pricing American Options using Longstaff-Schwartz Algorithm and Tsitsiklis-Van Roy Algorithm </li> 
  <li> We also look at Duality in case of these options and how to get upper-bound from the Dual problem </li>
  <li> Using BSDEs how we can price reinsurance products assuming uncertain mortality </li>
  <li> Finally we also look at SLV (Stochastic Local Volatility) Model and how to calibrate smile using them </li>
  </ul>
